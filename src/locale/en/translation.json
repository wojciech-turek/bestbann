        "title": "Why should I use banneton baskets?",
        "description": "<p>Many people do not realise how important it is to store dough properly while it is rising. It must be kept at the right temperature and then transferred to a special container. The best way to do this is to place the dough in a <strong>rattan bread proofing banneton basket</strong>. This will give the loaves an ideal shape and symmetry, without any unnecessary indentations that can cause the dough to sag. In addition, the rising process will give the loaf a soft centre with a wonderfully porous texture, and the surrounding crust will be pleasantly crispy.</p>"

It is therefore worth considering which <strong>rattan bread proofing basket</strong> will best suit your needs before purchasing. Of course, the most important distinguishing feature of <strong>banneton baskets</strong> is size. Both small and large bannetons are worth considering. The latter will allow you <strong>to bake bread</strong> weighing more than 2 kilograms. The shape of <strong>the proving basket</strong> also plays an important role - it is good if it is similar to the form in which the dough will be baked or to the size of the oven in order to fill it effectively.</p>"

        "title": "Preparing bread in a basket",
        "description": "<p>There are many recipes for delicious homemade bread, but the basic ingredients are almost always wheat or rye flour, water, salt and, of course, sourdough. The dough should be of an optimal consistency, so it must be kneaded well by hand or in an electric mixer. The dough is then placed in <strong>rattan bread baskets</strong> and the surface is sprinkled with flour. To ensure that the dough rises properly, it is advisable to place it in a warm place and cover it. When the dough has risen sufficiently, it is ready to be baked, having reached the ideal height and consistency.</p>"

        "description": "<p>After each use, it is necessary to check the condition of the basket. It is recommended that you remove any dough or flour residue and allow the <strong>rattan basket</strong> to dry at room temperature. Dry brushes with soft bristles are useful for cleaning. <strong>Bannetons</strong> made from this material should not be rinsed with water as they will absorb too much water, causing mould to form. Nor should they be treated with detergents. It is best to store them in a dry place, away from dust.</p>"

Despite the fact that the baskets have no visible holes or perforations, the rising dough breathes and the proofing process takes place flawlessly through the micro-gaps between the cork granulate fractions. Thanks to the natural roughness of cork we obtain the effect of good adhesion of flour to the inner edges of the forms, which <strong>prevents the dough from sticking and helps it fall out of the bannetons</strong> after the proofing process is completed.</p>",
        "paragraph3": "<p><strong>The baskets are durable and can be washed many times</strong>, even in hot water. Cork material, thanks to the presence of tannins in its composition and the absence of protein substances prone to decomposition, retains its <strong>resistance to mould and mildew</strong>, which is a great advantage over bannetons made of rattan or wicker, which are relatively quickly subject to such processes. Its surface and structure do not provide a breeding ground for fungi and mould and do not create conditions for them to colonize. Cork material has an increased resistance to biological corrosion resulting from moisture and conditions conducive to rotting processes often found in bakeries. Cork baskets have very good thermal insulation properties, which helps the dough for bread to rise by retaining some of the heat inside the basket.</p>",

It has a beautiful appearance, a crispy crust, a soft interior and a unique aroma. It can be enriched with a variety of additives, such as seeds or fruit, and remains good for your health because it is made from natural, simple ingredients. If you are looking for the best baking accessories, you should also choose a <strong>basket for rising</strong> and <strong>proofing bread dough</strong>.

Instead of buying ready-made products, many men and women are taking the time to create ingenious baked goods using recipes they have found on the internet or passed down from their ancestors. Their motives for doing so vary greatly: some do it for health reasons, as part of a particular diet, while others see it as a hobby. Whatever the reason, there is great satisfaction in making your own bread, especially if you use quality products such as a <strong>basket for proofing dough</strong> and <strong>baking bread</strong>.</p>"

What should you consider when choosing the best accessories? First of all, consider the size of bread you will be baking. The smallest <strong>proofing baskets</strong> will allow you to <strong>rise dough</strong> weighing well under a kilogram, while larger ones are ideal if you prefer large baked goods. Customers should also consider the desired shape of the basket, such as round or oblong - it is important to match it to the container in which the loaf will be baked.</p>",
      "paragraph2": "<p><strong>For professionals and bakers</strong>: Before choosing baskets, consider what type of <strong>proofing and rising baskets</strong> are best suited to the dough being used - will it be <strong>rattan and cork baskets</strong>, which are popular in artisan bakeries? Or <strong>bamboo fiber plastic and polypropylene baskets</strong>, which are used in large industrial bakeries because they are easy to clean and maintain? Bread doughs also vary in moisture content - for doughs with a high-water content, we recommend <strong>liners that prevent the dough from sticking to the basket</strong>. The shape and size of the banneton baskets are also important and should be chosen so that the dough fills the baskets perfectly and fits into the proofing space.</p>"

Before using <strong>bread proofing and rising baskets</strong>, you need to prepare them because even a small outbreak of mould can have a negative effect on baking. Before using the <strong>banneton basket</strong> for the first time, moisten it slightly with water and then sprinkle it generously with flour. After using the basket, it is necessary to remove the remaining flour and clean the centre with a dry brush so that only a thin layer of flour remains on the basket. The next time you use the baskets, you do not need to wet them, just sprinkle them generously with flour.</p>"

Traditional breads are usually made from rye or wheat flour, sourdough starter, salt and water. The ingredients are thoroughly mixed and kneaded and then formed into balls or oblongs. The dough is then placed in a floured <strong>banneton basket</strong> to rise. After a few hours, the dough is ready to be baked, so all you have to do is take it out of the basket and put it in a very hot oven or a special stone oven.</p>"
